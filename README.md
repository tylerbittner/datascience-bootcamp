# datascience-bootcamp repo
This repo contains exercises, course notes, and Jupyter notebooks from my [Data Science Career Accelerator](https://mailchi.mp/0f6cbc6dc24c/data_career_accelerator) mentored by [Lauren (Washington) Grummert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-grummert-0978ba8/).  The custom curriculum is modeled after [Thinkful's 12-week Data Science program](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/data-science/flexible/), which she also mentored for previously.
